# NeuroTrack

## Overview

**NeuroTrack** is a Unity-based project where cars learn to drive using **evolutionary neural networks** and 
reinforcement-inspired feedback. Built with **C# in Unity**, the project explores how AI can adapt driving strategies 
through generations of trial and error.

The long-term goal is to evolve AI agents that can navigate complex tracks with minimal human intervention, much like 
how real-world self-driving cars refine their control systems through data and simulation.

## Current Version

**NeuroTrack** currently supports:

- A **realistic top-down driving model** with traction, drift, and angular velocity.  
- Custom Unity **assets** for cars and tracks, making testing environments modular and scalable.  
- A defined **neural network input/output pipeline**, preparing cars to be controlled by AI.  
- Early **evolutionary framework**, with genes and mutation mechanics under development.

### Features

- **Neural Network Inputs:**
  - Sensor Distances ∈ [0, 1] (5 sensors, where 0 = obstacle very close, 1 = no obstacle within range)
  - Forward Velocity ∈ [−1, 1] (normalized by expected maximum speed; −1 = full reverse, +1 = full forward)
  - Lateral Velocity ∈ [−1, 1] (normalized sideways slip; −1 = max left drift, +1 = max right drift)

- **Network Outputs:**
  - Steer ∈ [−1, 1] (−1 = full left steer, +1 = full right steer)
  - Throttle ∈ [−1, 1] (−1 = full reverse, 0 = coasting, +1 = full forward)

- **Evolutionary Design:** Neural network weights are encoded as “genes” that mutate across generations, 
enabling the population to gradually improve driving ability.  

- **Reinforcement-Inspired Feedback:** Cars are rewarded for progress, speed, and survival while being penalized 
for collisions.

## Next Steps

- **Neural Network Implementation:**  
  Building and testing the feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) to process sensor and velocity inputs.

- **Genetic Algorithm Integration:**  
  Evolving network weights across generations to improve driving strategies.

- **Track Generalization:**  
  Training cars to adapt to new tracks rather than overfitting to a single course.

- **Visualization Tools:**  
  Adding real-time fitness metrics, genome visualization, and replay analysis.

## Project Inspiration

This project is inspired by [A.I. Learns to Drive From Scratch in Trackmania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX08NT55YhA), 
where Yosh trained an AI model to drive in *Trackmania*. He demonstrated how **neural networks can learn 
driving techniques such as cornering and acceleration timing through iterative training.  

**NeuroTrack** applies a similar concept in Unity, but with a **top-down driving model** that balances physics realism 
with accessible experimentation. The aim is to explore how cars can evolve intelligent driving strategies using nothing 
but simulated sensors and feedback.
