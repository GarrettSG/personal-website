# Personal Website

My personal website serves as both a portfolio and a living sandbox for modern web development.  
It is built with **Next.js** for high-performance rendering, styled with **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, 
responsive UI design, and deployed through **Vercel** for seamless hosting and continuous integration 
via **GitHub**.  
All content pages are powered by **Markdown files**, making it simple to manage and update site content 
while maintaining a clean separation of concerns.  

**GitHub Repository:** [github.com/GarrettSG/personal-website](https://github.com/GarrettSG/personal-website)
