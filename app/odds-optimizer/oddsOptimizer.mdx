# OddsOptimizerAPI

## Overview

I am building a **sports betting API** that allows users to retrieve and compare betting lines from multiple sportsbooks. The long-term goal of this project is to create a fully-featured API where users can query for sports betting lines across different sportsbooks and easily identify the most favorable odds for a given game.

This project demonstrates practical web scraping, API design with FastAPI, and working with modern Python tools for real-time data collection.

## Current Version: [OddsOptimizerAPI](https://github.com/GarrettSG/OddsOptimizerApi)

**OddsOptimizerAPI** is the latest iteration of this project. It is built with **FastAPI** and **Playwright**, and it can:

- Scrape betting lines from sportsbooks such as **DraftKings** and **BetMGM**.
- Return the data as a **JSON-formatted response**, suitable for integration with other applications or web services.
- Run asynchronously, handling multiple requests efficiently.

The API is structured following **Controller and Service best practices**, making it modular and easy to extend for additional sportsbooks or sports leagues.

### Features

- **League Support:** NFL, MLB, NBA, NCAAF
- **Scraping Libraries:** Playwright for browser automation, BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- **Safe Data Parsing:** Converts spreads, spread lines, and moneylines safely to Python numeric types
- **Ready for Integration:** JSON responses allow easy use in dashboards, apps, or data pipelines
- **GitHub Repository:** [OddsOptimizerAPI](https://github.com/GarrettSG/OddsOptimizerApi)

## Next Steps

- **Deploy API as an Azure Function App:** Making the API accessible as a cloud-hosted service.
- **Utilize Azure API Management Features:** To enable secure, interactive access to the API directly on my personal website.
- **Create an Interactive Website Feature:** Allow users to query and compare betting lines in real-time through a web interface.

The **OddsOptimizer** project is an **early-stage proof-of-concept** that helped me explore web scraping for sports betting. Key aspects include:

- **Terminal-based Application:** Runs locally and prints results to the terminal.
- **Sportsbooks Compared:** DraftKings, BetMGM, Bally Bets
- **Functionality:** Displays the **most favorable line** among multiple sportsbooks for a given game.

This project helped validate my scraping techniques and informed the design of the more robust API in **OddsOptimizerAPI**.
