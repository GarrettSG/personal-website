As a member of the **Technology Committee** for the Delta Gamma Chapter of Theta Tau, I lead the **frontend development** 
of our chapter website and assist with backend integrations that support member management and internal tools.

My work focuses on building a modern, responsive interface that reflects the professionalism and culture of the fraternity, 
while ensuring maintainability and ease of collaboration.

Key responsibilities include:

- **Leading frontend architecture** using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, implementing dynamic layouts, responsive 
design patterns, and reusable UI components.  
- **Collaborating on backend integration** efforts, including form handling, user data management, and authentication 
tied to a **MongoDB** database.  
- **Maintaining project organization** using **GitHub Projects storyboards**, breaking work into well-defined issues 
and tracking progress from planning to deployment.  
- **Deploying and monitoring the site** via **Vercel**, ensuring high uptime and seamless CI/CD workflows.
