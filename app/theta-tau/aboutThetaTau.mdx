# Theta Tau – Professional Engineering Fraternity

**Theta Tau** is the oldest and largest co-ed professional engineering fraternity in the United States. Founded 
in 1904, Theta Tau is committed to developing engineers into **well-rounded, ethical, and professionally competent 
leaders** through a combination of academic support, professional development, and lifelong brotherhood.

The fraternity is open to students from all engineering disciplines and provides a strong support network that 
extends beyond college into careers in industry, research, and entrepreneurship. Theta Tau fosters a culture of 
**collaboration, leadership, and innovation**, empowering members to make meaningful contributions in both their 
fields and communities.

At Arizona State University, Theta Tau maintains an active presence through:

- **Professional development events** such as technical workshops, networking nights, and résumé reviews  
- **Community service projects** that give back to the local Tempe and Phoenix area  
- **Brotherhood events** that build strong interpersonal connections among engineering students  
- Opportunities to grow in **leadership roles**, take initiative in event planning, and contribute to chapter development
